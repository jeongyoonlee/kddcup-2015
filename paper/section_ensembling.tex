\section{Multi-Stage Ensemble}
Stratified 5-fold cross validation (CV).
We used xgboost \cite{xgboost}, neural nets and linear regression for stage-II ensembling.

\subsection{Stage-I Ensemble}
We trained 20 stage-I ensemble classifiers with different subsets of CV predictions of 63 individual classifiers.

\subsection{Stage-II Ensemble}
We trained 2 stage-II ensemble classifiers with different subsets of CV predictions of 20 stage-I ensemble classifiers.

\subsection{Stage-III Ensemble}
We trained a stage-III ensemble classifier with CV predictions of 5 classifiers: 2 stage-II ensemble, 2 stage-I ensemble, and 1 individual classifiers.
\\

Finally we ended up with linear ensembling with 39 courseID correction factors.
These 39 factors improved the score from 0.90910 to 0.90918.
