We used the multi-stage ensemble with stacked generalization \cite{wolpert1992stacked, ting1999issues} to blend predictions of multiple models.  At each stage, we train ensemble models with 5-fold CV, and use the CV and test predictions of models in the previous stage as inputs.  Then, we pass the CV and test predictions of the ensemble models to the next stage as inputs.  Figure 4 illustrates the process of multi-stage ensemble with 5-fold CV stacked generalization.
