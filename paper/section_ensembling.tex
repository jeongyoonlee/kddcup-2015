\section{Stage2 ensemble}
We used xgboost \cite{xgboost}, neural nets and linear regression for stage2 ensembling.

\section{Stage3 ensemble}
We tried xgboost and linear stage3 ensembling.
Finnaly we ended up with linear ensembling with 39 courseID correction factors.
These 39 factors improved the score from 0.9091 to 0.90918.
