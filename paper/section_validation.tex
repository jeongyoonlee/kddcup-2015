We use stratified 5-fold cross validation to estimate the performance of single and ensemble models:
Training data are split into five folds while the sample size and dropout rate are preserved across folds.

For validation, each of single and ensemble models is trained five times. Each time, one fold is held out and the remaining four folds are used for training. Then, predictions for the hold-out folds are combined and form the model's CV prediction. CV predictions are used in AUC score calculation and/or as inputs in ensemble model training.

For test, each of single and ensemble models is retrained with whole training data. Then predictions for test data are used for submission and/or as inputs in ensemble model prediction.
