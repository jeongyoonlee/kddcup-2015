\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we demonstrated a comprehensive pipeline from the raw data to the final dropout prediction with best practices in  predictive modeling.  It started from feature engineering that extracts both hand craft and automated features.  At this step, discovering key features (such as F7 in Section 2.9) played a key role for us to proceed close to top. Then, we trained 64 single models with 8 classification algorithms. Lastly, the multi-stage ensemble allows us to fully harness predictive signals in the extracted features and trained single models, and to finish the 1st.

Here we made 2 major contributions.  First, our feature engineering approach can be useful for customer churn prediction in publishing, financial services, insurance, electric utilities, health care, banking, Internet, telephone, and cable service industries, where similar customer log data are available.  Second, we pushes forward current state-of-the-art ensemble method with our multi-stage ensemble framework.
