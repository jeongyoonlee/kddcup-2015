\section{Conclusions}
Our final AUC score of 0.90918 results from a complex pipeline from raw data to final score.
Every part of that pipe needs to be (sub-)optimal implemented by our team to get the best score at the end.
The first part ``feature design'' is the most important one and needs expertise, experience and of course a bit luck to capture all signals in the data.
