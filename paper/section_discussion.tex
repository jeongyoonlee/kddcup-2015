\section{Discussion}
At KDD Cup 2015, GBM outperforms other algorithms.  Our top 8 single models as well as top 2 stage-1 ensemble models are trained with GBM.\\

Performance improvement diminishes as we add more ensemble stages.  The stage-1 ensemble improves the CV AUC score by XXXX from 0.906721 to 0.907688.  The stage-2 ensemble improves the CV AUC score by XXXX to 0.907968.  The stage-3 ensemble improves the CV AUC score by XXXX to 0.908194.\\

We choose subsets of predictions from the previous stage for ensemble model training,
