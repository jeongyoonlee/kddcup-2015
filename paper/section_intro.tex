\section{Introduction}
Our final solution is a joint work from 9 data scientists, distributed around the world.
The pipeline from raw data to final solution is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Hand crafted feature engineering (most of hard work)
  \item Automatic feature design (autoencoder)
  \item Individual models (gbm, nn, factor model,..)
  \item Stage-I ensemble (blends individual models)
  \item Stage-II ensemble (blends stage-I ensemble models)
  \item Stage-III ensemble (blends stage-II ensemble models)
\end{itemize}

% I think our ensemble framework is different from Otto competition winner's:  Theirs is a stage-II and ours is a stage-III.
% This approach was published by a winning team of Otto kaggle competition \cite{otto},\cite{triskelion}.

\section{Dataset}
We got history from 200k enrollments, from 120k we know the labels.
