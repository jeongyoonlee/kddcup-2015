\section{Introduction}
Our final solution is a joint work from 9 data scientists, distibuted around the world.
The pipeline from raw data to final solution is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Hand crafted feature design (most of hard work)
  \item Automatic feature design (autoencoder)
  \item Individual models (gbm, nn, factor model,..)
  \item Stage2 ensemble (blends individuals)
  \item Stage3 ensemble (blends Stage2's)
\end{itemize}

This approach was published by a winning team of Otto kaggle competition \cite{otto},\cite{triskelion}.

\section{Dataset}
We got history from 200k enrollments, from 120k we know the labels.
