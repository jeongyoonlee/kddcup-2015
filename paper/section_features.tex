\section{Feature Engineering}
Our team members extracted 7 feature sets, namely F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, and F7 from raw data independently.

\subsection{Data Sets}
Activity logs of 200,906 enrollments from 112,448 students across 39 courses are provided.
Each activity is described by 6 fields of the username, course ID, timestamp, source, event, and object. 
For each object, 3 additional fields of the category, children, and start date are provided.
The training set consists of 8,157,278 logs from 120,543 enrollments with the target variable indicating if a student dropped out.  
The test set consists of 5,387,848 logs from 80,363 enrollments.
The full description of the data sets is available in \cite{kddcup2015_data}. In general, this data can be organized in three dimension space, object, time, and event as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cube}. Feature engineering tasks were carried out based on these views.

\subsection{Common Features}
Attributes available from raw data
There are common features across 7 feature sets, F1 through F7 as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Number of objects
	\item Number of events
	\item Aggregation features of features above
\end{itemize}
The common features can be generated using cube operations. Figure~\ref{fig:slice} shows an example how weekly and monthly count features are calculated. First, the data is cut using object dimension. In this case, we choose to generate feature for users. Next, we select an event "navigate" in the event space to generate a time series presenting "navigate" event over the time. Finally, the drill-down operation is used to generate monthly or weekly count features.

  \item Number of courses the user enrolled
  \item Minimum time interval between time points(first visit, last visit, course begin, course end, 10 days after course end) of current course and another enrolled course
  \item Active days between course end and 10 days after course end
  \item Active days between last visit and course end
  \item Number of courses ended after current course end
\end{itemize}

Table~\ref{tb:rwfeature} shows the full list of features in F2.

\subsection{F3}
The feature set F3 is generated by Nguyen, and are categorized into 3 groups of the count, aggregation, and date features.

\subsubsection{Count Features}
There are a few entities such as user, course, and object in the training dataset.  Combining these entities together, we have user activities or events.  The simplest way to generate features from these events is to count the number of times an entity engaging in the event. The motivation is that the more a user participate in course, the less likely she drop out the course. Table~\ref{tb:tnfeature1} shows the list of count features in F1. 

\begin{center}
	\begin{table}[ht]
		\begin{minipage}{0.5 \textwidth}
			{
							\caption{List of count features in F3.}
				\small
				\hfill{}
				\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
					\hline
					\textbf{No.}	&\textbf{Description}\tabularnewline \hline
					1 			& The log count of each user \tabularnewline
					2 			& The log count of each course \tabularnewline
					3			& The log count of each event \tabularnewline
					4 			& The log count of each user per week \tabularnewline
					5 			& The log count of each user per two weeks \tabularnewline
					6 			& The log count of each user per weekday \tabularnewline
					7 			& The log count of each user per month\tabularnewline
					8 			& The log count of each course per week \tabularnewline
					9 			& The log count of each course per two weeks \tabularnewline
					10 			& The log count of each course per weekday\tabularnewline
					11 			& The log count of each course per month \tabularnewline
					12 			& The log count of each event per week \tabularnewline
					13 			& The log count of each event per two weeks \tabularnewline
					14 			& The log count of each event per weekday \tabularnewline
					15 			& The log count of each event per month \tabularnewline
					\hline
				\end{tabular}
			}
			\hfill{}
			\label{tb:tnfeature1}
		\end{minipage}
	\end{table}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Aggregation Features}
Aggregation features are calculated based on count features. Usually, each course would have a fixed schedule for users to study. Therefore, students enrolled in the course must have consistent activity patterns.  Aggregation features would measure the stability of course engagement.  These features are minimum, mean, median, maximum, and standard deviation of count features on date basis such as weekly, monthly, etc.

\subsubsection{Date Features}
To capture how often users participate in a certain course, we generated date features. Date features can be time span among user activities as well as time span from last activity and last course date. Table~\ref{tb:tnfeature3} shows the list of date features in F3. 

\begin{center}
	\begin{table}[ht]
		\begin{minipage}{0.5 \textwidth}
			{
							\caption{List of date features in F3.}
				\small
				\hfill{}
				\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
					\hline
					\textbf{No.}	&\textbf{Description}\tabularnewline \hline
					1 			& Min time span among activities \tabularnewline
					2 			& Max time span among activities \tabularnewline
					3 			& Mean time span among activities \tabularnewline
					4 			& Time span from the last activity and last course date \tabularnewline
					5 			& The number of unique activity days of each user \tabularnewline
					\hline
				\end{tabular}
			}
			\hfill{}

  \item For each 10 days after the end date of the course, number of active enrollment\_id (in this case, days between last access and the end date of the course are also counted for active days), which target variables are 1 in the training set, enrolled by an username.
  \item For each 10 days after the end date of the course, number of active enrollment\_id (in this case, days between last access and the end date of the course are also counted for active days), which target variables are 0 in the training set, enrolled by an username.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Denoising Autoencoder Features}
We generate denoising autoencoder (DAE) \cite{hinton2006reducing} features from feature sets above and use those as additional features.  
We experiment with two autoencoder networks:
\begin{itemize}
  \setlength\itemsep{0em}
  \item \textbf{Deep Stack} \cite{vincent2010stacked}: It is an architecture with input-x-x-x-input, where $x=1,000$ for example.
The resulting feature dimensionality is $3 \times x$. We extract outputs from all layers as new features.
  \item \textbf{Bottleneck}  \cite{sainath2012auto} : It is an architecture with one layer with significantly fewer neurons such as input-1000-1000-30-1000-1000-input for example, which results in 30 features.
\end{itemize}
Both variants are trained with stochastic mini-batch SGD on the original training and test feature set.
We use the ReLU transfer function in hidden layers and the linear function in the output and bottleneck layers.
