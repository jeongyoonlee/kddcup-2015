\section{Feature Engineering}
Our team members extracted 7 feature sets, namely F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, and F7 from raw data independently.

\subsection{Data Sets}
Activity logs of 200,906 enrollments from 112,448 students across 39 courses are provided.
Each activity is described by 6 fields of the username, course ID, timestamp, source, event, and object. 
For each object, 3 additional fields of the category, children, and start date are provided.
The training set consists of 8,157,278 logs from 120,543 enrollments with the target variable indicating if a student dropped out.  
The test set consists of 5,387,848 logs from 80,363 enrollments.
The full description of the data sets is available in \cite{kddcup2015_data}.

\subsection{Common Features}
There are common features across 7 feature sets as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item blah
\end{itemize}

\subsection{F1}

\subsection{F3}
These features were generated by Tam. They can be categorized into three major groups, count, aggregation, and date features. The list of features is as follows:
\subsubsection{Count Feature}
There are a few entities such as user, course, and object in the training dataset. Combining these entities together, we have user activities or events. The simplest way to generate features from these events is to count the number of times an entity engaging in the event. The motivation is that the more does a user participate in course, the more chance does he drop out that course. The list of count features are given in Table~\ref{tb:tnfeature1}.

\begin{center}
	\begin{table*}[ht]
		\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
			{
				\small
				\hfill{}
				\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
					\hline
					\textbf{No.}&\textbf{Feature}&\textbf{Description}\tabularnewline \hline
					1 & User counts & The log count of each user \tabularnewline
					2 & Course count & The log count of each course \tabularnewline
					3 & Event count & The log count of each event \tabularnewline
					4 & User weekly count & The log count of each user per week \tabularnewline
					5 & User bi-weekly count & The log count of each user per two weeks \tabularnewline
					6 & User weekday count & The log count of each user per weekday \tabularnewline
					7 & User monthly count & The log count of each user per month\tabularnewline
					8 & Course weekly count & The log count of each course per week \tabularnewline
					9 & Course bi-weekly count & The log count of each course per two weeks \tabularnewline
					10 & Course weekday count & The log count of each course per weekday\tabularnewline
					11 & Course monthly count & The log count of each course per month \tabularnewline
					12 & Event weekly count & The log count of each event per week \tabularnewline
					13 & Event bi-weekly count & The log count of each event per two weeks \tabularnewline
					14 & Event weekday count & The log count of each event per weekday \tabularnewline
					15 & Event monthly count & The log count of each event per month \tabularnewline
					\hline
				\end{tabular}
			}
			\hfill{}
			\caption{List of count features generated by Tam.}
			\label{tb:tnfeature1}
		\end{minipage}
	\end{table*}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Aggregation Feature}
Aggregation features were calculated based on count features. Usually, each course would have a fixed schedule for users to study. Therefore, students roll in the course must have stable activity patterns. Aggregation features would measure the stability of course engagement. These features are mean, median, standard deviation of count on date basis such as weekly, monthly, etc. The list of aggregation features are given in Table~\ref{tb:tnfeature2}.

\begin{center}
	\begin{table*}[ht]
		\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
			{
				\small
				\hfill{}
				\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
					\hline
					\textbf{No.}&\textbf{Feature}&\textbf{Description}\tabularnewline \hline
					1 & Min & Min of all above count features \tabularnewline
					2 & Max & Max of all above count features \tabularnewline
					3 & Mean & Mean of all above count features \tabularnewline
					4 & Median & Median of all above count features \tabularnewline
					5 & Std & Standard deviation of all above count features  \tabularnewline
					\hline
				\end{tabular}
			}
			\hfill{}
			\caption{List of aggregation features generated by Tam.}
			\label{tb:tnfeature2}
		\end{minipage}
	\end{table*}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Date Feature}
To capture how often users participate in a certain course, we generated date features. Date features can be time span among user activities as well as time span from last activity and last course date. The list of date features is given in Table~\ref{tb:tnfeature3}.

\begin{center}
	\begin{table*}[ht]
		\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
			{
				\small
				\hfill{}
				\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
					\hline
					\textbf{No.}&\textbf{Feature}&\textbf{Description}\tabularnewline \hline
					1 & Min time span & Min time span among activities \tabularnewline
					2 & Max time span & Max time span among activities \tabularnewline
					3 & Mean time span & Mean time span among activities \tabularnewline
					4 & Last time span & Time span from the last activity and last course date \tabularnewline
					5 & Number of unique days & The number of unique activity days of each user \tabularnewline
					\hline
				\end{tabular}
			}
